<!--User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".
User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".
User Story #3:  When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element 
                is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
User Story #4:  When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, 
                the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type 
                (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import 
                the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
User Story #5:  When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor 
                field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each 
                of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a 
                link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should 
                be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
Optional Bonus  (you do not need to make this test pass): 
                When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab 
                (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).
Optional Bonus  (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns 
                and renders them as br (line break) elements.

# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:
          
Heres some code, `<div></div>`, between 2 backticks.
        
```
// this is multi-line code:
        
function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
if (firstLine == '```' && lastLine == '```') {
return multiLineCode;
}
}
```
          
You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.
        
There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
> Block Quotes!
        
And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:
        
Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.
        
- And of course there are lists.
- Some are bulleted.
- With different indentation levels.
- That look like this.
        
        
1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want! 
1. But the list goes on...
- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

        <button id='clear-editor'>Clear Editor</button>
